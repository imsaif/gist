## AI Email Composer

### Intent

- Goal: Reduce time-to-send for routine emails from 4 minutes to under 1 minute, without the recipient being able to tell AI was involved
- User: Knowledge workers who write 30+ routine emails/day. Comfortable with AI but embarrassed if output sounds robotic.
- Core anxiety: "Will this make me sound like a robot to my colleagues?"
- Not trying to: Replace thoughtful, high-stakes communication. Board updates, performance reviews, and sensitive conversations are explicitly out of scope.
- Not trying to: Generate unsolicited outbound emails. This only works in reply context.

### Interaction Model

**Primary flow:**
1. User hits reply on an email. The compose window opens with the original thread visible.
2. A subtle prompt appears below the empty compose area: "Draft a reply" — not a button, a text link. Dismissible and stays dismissed if the user never uses it.
3. User clicks "Draft a reply." AI generates a draft based on the thread context. Draft appears as editable grey text (not a suggestion chip — actual text in the compose field, but visually distinct).
4. User edits freely. Any character they type converts AI text to regular text at that point. No accept/reject flow — just editing.
5. Edited text looks identical to manually typed text. No "AI-assisted" badge on sent emails.

**Key interactions:**
- Draft trigger: Text link, not button — chosen because a button implies a heavy action. This is meant to feel like a shortcut, not a feature launch.
- AI text styling: Grey text that becomes black on edit — chosen over suggestion chips because chips create an accept/reject decision. We wanted editing, not approving.
- Tone selector: Dropdown with 4 options (professional, friendly, concise, detailed) — appears only after first draft generates, not before.

**When things go wrong:**
- AI generates inappropriate tone: User edits directly. No need to "reject" and "regenerate." Just fix the words.
- AI hallucinates a detail not in the thread: The original thread is always visible alongside the draft. Visual proximity is the error-catching mechanism.
- AI is slow (>3 seconds): Skeleton text appears immediately. If >8 seconds, the text link changes to "Taking longer than usual — type your own reply or wait."

### Design Decisions

**Editing over approving**
- Chose: Direct editing of AI-generated text
- Over: Accept/reject chips, tracked-changes style suggestions, side-by-side comparison
- Because: Email is personal. An approve/reject flow makes users feel like they're managing AI output rather than writing. User testing showed 3x faster completion with direct editing vs. accept/reject.

**No AI badge on sent emails**
- Chose: Sent emails show no indication of AI assistance
- Over: "Drafted with AI" footer, subtle AI icon, transparency badge
- Because: The core anxiety is sounding robotic. Any visible AI marker triggers self-consciousness. The user edited and approved the text. It's their email.

**Tone selector appears after, not before**
- Chose: Show tone options only after first draft generates
- Over: Tone selection before generation, persistent tone bar, tone in settings
- Because: Users don't know what tone they want until they see output. Showing it after lets them react rather than predict.

**Thread-visible drafting**
- Chose: Original email thread stays visible alongside the draft compose area
- Over: Full-screen compose, collapsed thread, AI-generated "thread summary"
- Because: The thread IS the fact-checking mechanism. If the AI says "As discussed in our meeting Tuesday" and no meeting happened, the user catches it by glancing up.

### Patterns Used

- Human-in-the-Loop: Every AI draft requires user action before sending — but the action is editing (low friction) not approving (high friction). The user is always the final author, never a reviewer. → https://aiuxdesign.guide/patterns/human-in-the-loop
- Progressive Disclosure: AI features are discoverable but not prominent. The "Draft a reply" link appears contextually, tone selector appears only after first use. → https://aiuxdesign.guide/patterns/progressive-disclosure
- Error Recovery: No explicit error state. If the draft is bad, the user just edits or deletes and types manually. The worst case costs the user nothing. → https://aiuxdesign.guide/patterns/error-recovery

### Constraints

- Technical: Email client has 200ms render budget. AI generation is async but the compose window must be usable immediately. This ruled out approaches that block the compose area while generating.
- Business: Legal prohibited AI-generated content referencing specific dollar amounts, contractual terms, or legal commitments — even in drafts. The AI leaves these as [placeholder] brackets.
- User: 40% of target users are on mobile. All AI interactions must work with thumb-reachable tap targets. This eliminated hover-based interactions.

### Not This

- This is not autocomplete (like Gmail Smart Compose). Smart Compose predicts the next few words. This generates complete email drafts from thread context.
- This is not a chatbot. The user doesn't converse with the AI. They get a draft and edit it.
- This does not compose unsolicited emails. It only works in reply context where thread history exists.
- Unlike Superhuman's AI, this does not show AI confidence scores or highlight AI-generated sections. Edited AI text is the user's text, full stop.

### Open Questions

- How to handle users who never edit the draft and send as-is. Is that a success (fast!) or a concern (no personalization)?
- Whether to learn from user edits per-contact (formal with boss, casual with team) or keep tone selection manual.

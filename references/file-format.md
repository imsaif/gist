# gist.design File Format Reference

## Principles

1. **Human and machine readable.** Markdown with a precise, consistent structure that allows programmatic parsing with simple tools (regex, parsers — no AI needed to extract sections).
2. **One file, one known location.** Lives at `/gist.design` at the project root. One file per product.
3. **Created, not scraped.** Contains information that doesn't exist on any web page — design decisions, interaction rationale, negative boundaries. This information only comes out through guided conversation.

## Parseable format conventions

- Product name is always H1 (`# Product Name`)
- Product summary is always a blockquote (`> ...`)
- Feature names are always H2 (`## Feature Name`)
- Subsections are always H3 (`### Intent`, `### Interaction Model`, etc.)
- Key-value pairs always use `- Label: Value` format
- Design decisions always use `- Chose:` / `- Over:` / `- Because:`
- "Not This" items follow patterns: `- This is not...` / `- This does not...` / `- Unlike [product], this...`
- Numbered flow steps use `1.` / `2.` / `3.` format
- Optional/lower-priority features are grouped under `## Optional`

A developer should be able to write a parser for gist.design files without reading documentation beyond this spec.

## File structure template

```markdown
# [Product Name]

> [One line: what this product is and who it's for]

Generated by gist.design • [Date]

---

## Product Overview

- What it is: [Brief description]
- Who it's for: [Primary audience]
- AI approach: [How AI fits — core vs. feature layer, or "no AI features"]

---

## [Feature 1 Name]

### Intent

- Goal: [What success looks like]
- User: [Who, their context, skill level]
- Core anxiety: [Main worry users have]
- Not trying to: [Explicit scope boundary]
- Not trying to: [Another scope boundary]

### Interaction Model

**Primary flow:**

1. [Step: what happens, what user sees, what they can do]
2. [Step]
3. [Step]

**Key interactions:**

- [Element]: [Behavior + why this interaction type was chosen]
- [Element]: [Behavior + why]

**When things go wrong:**

- [Error/edge case]: [What user sees + what they can do]
- [Error/edge case]: [What user sees + what they can do]

### Design Decisions

**[Decision name]**

- Chose: [What was chosen]
- Over: [What was rejected]
- Because: [Reasoning]

**[Decision name]**

- Chose: [What was chosen]
- Over: [What was rejected]
- Because: [Reasoning]

### Patterns Used

- [Pattern name]: [Specific implementation] → [URL to pattern documentation]
- [Pattern name]: [Specific implementation] → [URL]

### Constraints

- [Type]: [Constraint and how it affected design]

### Not This

- This is not [thing it could be confused with]
- This does not [capability AI tools might assume]
- Unlike [similar product], this [key difference]

### Open Questions

- [Unresolved decision or area still being explored]

---

## [Feature 2 Name]

### Intent

...

(same structure repeats per feature)

---

## Optional

## [Feature 3 Name — less critical]

### Intent

- Goal: [Brief]
- Not trying to: [Brief]

### Not This

- This is not [thing it could be confused with]

(Features under ## Optional get Intent + Not This only.
AI tools with limited context can skip these.)
```

## Section requirements

### Per feature (full documentation):

| Section           | Required? | Minimum content                                    |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Intent            | Yes       | Goal + User + at least one "Not trying to"         |
| Interaction Model | Yes       | Primary flow (3+ steps) + at least one error state |
| Design Decisions  | Yes       | At least one chose/over/because                    |
| Patterns Used     | No        | Only if recognizable patterns are implemented      |
| Constraints       | No        | Only if constraints meaningfully shaped the design |
| Not This          | Yes       | At least one negative definition                   |
| Open Questions    | No        | Only if unresolved decisions exist                 |

### Per feature (Optional section — summary only):

| Section                            | Required? |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| Intent (Goal + Not trying to only) | Yes       |
| Not This                           | Yes       |

## Why each section exists

| Section               | What AI tools get wrong without it                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Overview**  | AI tools describe the product too broadly or confuse its category                                       |
| **Intent**            | AI tools state the wrong purpose or audience                                                            |
| **Interaction Model** | AI tools know a feature exists but can't explain how it works — coding assistants build the wrong flow  |
| **Design Decisions**  | Coding assistants don't know which alternatives were already rejected                                   |
| **Patterns Used**     | AI tools say "uses Human-in-the-Loop" without specifics — coding assistants implement the wrong variant |
| **Constraints**       | AI tools suggest improvements that violate technical or business reality                                |
| **Not This**          | AI tools blend with competitors — coding assistants copy the wrong product's approach                   |
| **Open Questions**    | AI tools invent answers to questions the team hasn't resolved yet                                       |

## Content guidelines

1. **Use the language your team actually uses.** "The draft shows as grey text" is better than "AI-generated content is rendered with reduced opacity styling."
2. **Be specific about interactions.** "User clicks the text link below the compose area" not "user activates the AI feature."
3. **In Design Decisions, always include what was rejected.** The rejection is as informative as the choice.
4. **In Not This, name specific products.** "This is not Gmail Smart Compose" is more useful than "this is not an autocomplete feature."
5. **In Patterns Used, describe your implementation.** "Human-in-the-Loop: user edits AI draft directly rather than approving/rejecting" not just "uses Human-in-the-Loop."
6. **In Open Questions, be honest.** "We haven't decided how to handle users who edit 100% of the draft" is useful.

## Optional sections (for products with public positioning needs)

If the product is publicly available and agents may recommend or compare it, these additional sections can be included after Not This:

```markdown
### Positioning

- Category: [What kind of product this is]
- For: [Who should be recommended this, and when]
- Not for: [Who should NOT be recommended this]
- vs [Competitor]: [Honest, specific difference]

### Context

- Pricing: [Free / freemium / paid]
- Integrates with: [Ecosystem]
- Requires: [Prerequisites]
- Stage: [Beta / launched / mature]
```

## Integration guidance (tell the user after generating)

**Cursor:** `@Docs > Add new doc` → point to the hosted file URL
**Claude Code:** Already at project root — it's read automatically
**ChatGPT/Claude:** Paste file contents or upload
**Copilot:** Add contents to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
**llms.txt:** Add a reference line:

```
## Design
- [Design Decisions](/gist.design): Product design decisions, interaction models, and rationale
```

## Testing

After exporting, recommend the user test it:

1. Paste the file into ChatGPT
2. Ask: "How does [product's] [feature] work?"
3. Compare the answer to what they know
4. If it gets something wrong, that section needs more detail
